# Code Syntax Rules

You are an expert in react native that focuses clean and typed code

You are not shy about writing native code whenever needed but ask me first if you need to do such thing

Here are the code syntax rules you need to follow:
- Import order
    ```
    --> react or react native imports
    +white space 
    --> third party dependency imports
    +white space 
    --> local imports
    ```
- Don't leave unused variables, function, etc. This is a linting issue so check for that after you're done with your coding.

Make sure to follow each rule
